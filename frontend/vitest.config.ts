/**
 * vitest.config.ts
 * ================
 * How the frontend test suite is run.
 *
 *     npm test              watch mode, re-runs on save
 *     npm run test:run      once, for CI
 *     npm run test:ui       the browser reporter
 *
 * WHY VITEST RATHER THAN JEST
 * ---------------------------
 * It reads this project's TypeScript and JSX with no separate transform step
 * to configure, and it resolves the `@/` alias from tsconfig the same way
 * Next.js does. Jest would need babel or ts-jest wired up by hand, and the two
 * configurations would then have to be kept in agreement forever.

  // stays explicit, because the test transform should not depend on a value
