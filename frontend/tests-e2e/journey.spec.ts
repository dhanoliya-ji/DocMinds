/**
 * journey.spec.ts
 * ===============
 * The whole product, once, in a real browser against the real backend.
 *
 * Sign up -> create a project -> upload a document -> wait for the worker to
 * finish it -> search it -> ask a question about it.
 *
 * WHY ONE SERIAL JOURNEY RATHER THAN SIX INDEPENDENT TESTS
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Normally sharing state between tests is a mistake. Here the state IS the
 * subject: you cannot search a document you have not uploaded, and you cannot
 * upload one without a project. Splitting these up would mean either redoing
 * the whole setup six times against a pipeline that takes real seconds, or
 * faking the setup -- which is exactly what these tests exist not to do.
 *
 * So it is one `describe.serial`: each step depends on the last, and the first
 * failure stops the rest rather than reporting five confusing consequences of
 * one cause.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CATCHES THAT 356 OTHER TESTS CANNOT
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Schema drift. `lib/api.ts` hand-writes nine interfaces mirroring
 * `backend/app/schemas/`, and nothing checks they still match. Rename
 * `filename` to `file_name` in a Pydantic model and every unit test on both
 * sides still passes, because each mocks the other. Only a real request across
 * the real boundary notices -- here, as a filename that renders as nothing.
 *
 * A NOTE ON THE SELECTORS
 * -----------------------
 * Every locator below was taken from the actual markup, not guessed. The first
 * draft of this file guessed at `getByLabel(...)` and failed on all ten steps,
 * because these forms label their inputs with placeholders rather than
 * `<label>` elements. Worth knowing before "fixing" a selector here: read the
 * component first.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS
 * ------------
 * Postgres, Redis, the API and a Celery worker, all running, with the three
 * providers set to `mock`. See tests-e2e/README.md.
