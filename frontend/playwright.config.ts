/**
 * playwright.config.ts
 * ====================
 * End-to-end tests: a real browser against the real backend.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COVER THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Every other test in this project mocks the boundary it is nearest to. The
 * Vitest suite mocks `lib/api`; the backend suite calls Python functions or
 * hits the ASGI app in-process. So the one thing neither can see is whether
 * the two halves actually agree.
 *
 * That matters here specifically, because the nine TypeScript interfaces in
 * `lib/api.ts` are hand-written to mirror `backend/app/schemas/`. Nothing
 * checks that they still match. Rename a field in a Pydantic schema and every
 * one of the 356 other tests still passes, while the running app quietly
 * renders `undefined`.
 *
 * These tests are the only thing in the repository that would notice.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE NOT PART OF `npm test`
 * -----------------------------------
 * They need Postgres, Redis, the API and a Celery worker all running. That is
 * a reasonable thing to ask of CI and an unreasonable thing to ask of someone
 * who just wants to run the unit tests, so they live behind their own command
 * and their own CI job.
 *
 *     npm run test:e2e
 *
 * The `webServer` block below starts the Next.js dev server automatically, but
 * the BACKEND must already be up -- see tests-e2e/README.md.
