===============
WHAT THIS FILE TESTS
--------------------
`services/chunker.py` -- the module that splits a document's text into the
pieces that get embedded, searched and cited.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS FIRST
--------------------------
The chunker is the densest piece of pure logic in the project: token-space
arithmetic, overlapping windows, page-aware splitting and index bookkeeping,
all with no database and no network. That combination makes it both the most
likely place for a subtle bug and the cheapest thing to test properly.

It is also the place where a bug is hardest to notice. Nothing crashes if
chunks silently lose their overlap or report the wrong page -- search quality
just quietly degrades, and citations start pointing a page or two off.

TIER 1: these tests need no database, no Redis and no API key. They run
anywhere `pip install -r requirements.txt` has been run.
