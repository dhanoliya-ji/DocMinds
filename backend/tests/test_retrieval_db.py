test_retrieval_db.py
====================
WHAT THIS FILE TESTS
--------------------
`services/retrieval.py` against a real PostgreSQL with pgvector -- the search
that everything else in the product depends on, and the multi-tenant filter
that keeps one organisation's documents invisible to another.

TIER 2. These skip cleanly when no database is reachable. See conftest.py for
why SQLite is not an acceptable substitute here: the query under test uses the
`vector` type and the `<=>` distance operator, so a SQLite run would be a
different test that passes while the real query is broken.

    docker compose up -d && alembic upgrade head

THE TEST THAT MATTERS MOST
--------------------------
`TestTenantIsolation`. Everything else in this file is about search quality --
worth having, but a bug there produces bad answers. A bug in the tenant filter
produces one company reading another company's documents, and nothing about
the system's behaviour would reveal it: the results would look perfectly
plausible.

It is asserted here from the outside, against real rows, because that is the
only way to know the filter is in the SQL rather than merely in the docstring.

WHY THE MOCK EMBEDDING PROVIDER IS USED
---------------------------------------
Its vectors are meaningless but DETERMINISTIC -- the same text always gives the
same vector. That is enough to test the plumbing: that a chunk's own text
retrieves that chunk, that filters narrow the results, and that another
tenant's rows never appear. Testing whether the embeddings are semantically
*good* is a different question, and not one a unit test can answer.
