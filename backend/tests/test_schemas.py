WHAT THIS FILE TESTS
--------------------
`schemas/` (Pydantic) and `db/base_class.py` (the table-name rule).

WHY SCHEMAS ARE WORTH TESTING
-----------------------------
They are the backend's outermost guarantee in both directions.

Inbound, they are the only validation there is -- no endpoint hand-checks a
field, because the schema already refused the request. Outbound, FastAPI
filters every response THROUGH the schema, which is what makes leaking a
password hash structurally impossible rather than something to remember.

That second property is the one worth a test. It holds only as long as no
password field is ever added to `UserOut`, and a well-meaning "let me just
expose this for debugging" is exactly how it would be lost.

TIER 1: pure object construction. No database.
