===========
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
Shared pytest setup. Everything here is available to every test file without
being imported -- that is pytest's convention for a file with this name.

THE TWO TIERS
-------------
Tests in this suite come in two kinds, and the split is deliberate.

    TIER 1  no database, no Redis, no API key, no network.
            Chunking, hashing, tokens, prompt building, schema validation.
            These ALWAYS run. If they fail, something is genuinely broken.

    TIER 2  needs a real PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension.
            Retrieval, the multi-tenant filter, the ownership cascade.
            These SKIP cleanly when no database is reachable.

WHY TIER 2 NEEDS A REAL POSTGRES
--------------------------------
The usual trick of swapping in SQLite does not work here. The queries under
test depend on things only Postgres has:

    - the `vector` column type and the `<=>` distance operator (pgvector)
    - JSONB
    - the HNSW index

A SQLite run would not be a cheaper version of these tests. It would be a
different test that passes while the real query is broken -- which is worse
than no test at all.

SO THEY SKIP RATHER THAN FAIL
-----------------------------
A contributor with no Docker running should see "9 skipped", not nine red
failures they cannot act on. Skipping keeps the signal honest: red means
broken, not "you have not started a container".

    docker compose up -d      # then Tier 2 runs too
